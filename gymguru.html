It might be their work routines, environment, time constraints or any other personal factor. But the most common and important factor is their lack of motivation which indirectly affects their consistency.</p>
                    <p>

                        There were few other problems that came up during the user interview like, no proper guidance during exercises, wrong postures that lead to injuries, no simple workouts for beginners and no workouts for seniors (50+).

                <p>In order to get an empathetic understanding of the users, one-on-one interview was conducted with 4 of them and I learnt about their day to day routines. I got to know about the factors that influence their workouts like, the place where they workout, what kind of exercises they prefer and most importantly their proficiency in them. Two of them preferred to have proper guidance while working out and told how inconvenient few apps were that use timers and list of exercises as a workout routine which requires lot of intervention in-between the exercises. The most important factor that was noticed during these interviews was lack of motivation among the users to maintain consistency in their routines.</p>
                    <p class="my-3">Here are few of the main questions asked during the user interview:
                        <ul class="mx-md-5 px-5 ">
                            <li>Why and how often do you exercise?</li>
                            <li>What type of exercise do you prefer?</li>
                            <li>Where do you exercise?</li>
                            <li> How long do you exercise?</li>
                            <li>Why do you think you are not able to reach your goal?</li>
                            <li>What are your daily troubles while exercising?</li>

                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>Basically, What? How? Why? method was used in the follow-up questions to clearly understand the responses given and I tried to implement the 5 Whys method to know the deep rooted difficulties.</p>
